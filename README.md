# Mib

Musical Instrument Library (Mib), is a mod that adds musical instruments meant to be interfaced by other mods.

This mod was made for ModFest Carnival, and was going to have a sister mod, [Orchestrate](https://github.com/GreenhouseTeam/orchestrate), but that mod has been delayed until after the fest.
